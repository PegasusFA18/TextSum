In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. 

Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. 

Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. 

Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources 

This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. 

Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive Risks 

These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. 

We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate 

We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. 

Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. 

Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following: 

•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; 

•our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; 

•our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; 

•the introduction of competitive websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; 

•changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; 

•timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; 

•the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; 

•the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; 

•the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; 

•variations in the mix of products and services we sell; 

•variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; 

•the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; 

•the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; 

•increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies; 

•the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items; 

•the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; 

•our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; 

•the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and 

Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks 

Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis. 

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: 

•government regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership; 

•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; 

•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; 

•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; 

•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; 

•laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; 

•lower levels of use of the Internet; 

•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; 

•lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; 

•difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; 

•different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; 

•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; 

•laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and 

•geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. 

Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. 

The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. In addition, we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. 

If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be Harmed 

As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. 

If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network. 

If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. 

Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. 

The Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations 

We expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory. 

This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). 

Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships 

Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites. We provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. 

As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. 

Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: 

•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; 

•variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and 

•difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. 

Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments 

We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. 

•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; 

•additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; 

•the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; 

•the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; 

•the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; 

•the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; 

•the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; 

•for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; 

•the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; 

•the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; 

•potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and 

•for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. 

In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. 

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. 

The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business 

The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. 

We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches 

As a result of our services being web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our customers, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harm our business. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. 

We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy 

If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results. 

Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. 

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. 

We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties 

Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. 

Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. 

Other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 

Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. 

We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile 

We have a rapidly evolving business model. 

•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; 

•fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; 

•changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; 

•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; 

•changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and 

•transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. 

Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. 

Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business 

Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. 

We Could Be Subject to Additional Sales Tax or Other Tax Liabilities 

We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system. 

The scope of such requirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. 

We Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilities 

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany 

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). 

The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. 

Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. 

Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks 

We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. 

We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations 

Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. 

We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture 

Some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. 

We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks 

We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 

In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. 

We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers 

In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions.
