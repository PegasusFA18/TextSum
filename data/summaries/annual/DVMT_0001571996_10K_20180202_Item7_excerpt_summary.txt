RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis.
ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.
Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented below facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.
Accordingly, for the periods presented, amortization of intangible assets represents amortization associated with intangible assets recognized in connection with the EMC merger transaction and the going-private transaction.
See "Business Unit Results" for further information regarding revenue from our products, services, and software offerings.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
(d)Consists of severance and facility action costs.
(b)Services gross margin percentages represent services gross margin as a percentage of services net revenue, and non-GAAP services gross margin percentages represent services gross margin as a percentage of non-GAAP services net revenue.
Although we experienced strong growth in all-flash and hyper-converged infrastructure products, we are experiencing reduced demand in ISG for certain elements of our storage portfolio, including traditional high-end and midrange storage offerings.
Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP operating income during Fiscal 2018 increased 34% to $6.9 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in operating income for VMware and, to a lesser extent, CSG.

As a result of the EMC merger transaction, we are expanding our existing securitization facilities to allow for additional funding of customer receivables in the capital markets.
In ISG, we are seeing increased interest in flexible consumption models by our customers as they seek to build greater flexibility into their cost structures.
We expect these flexible consumption models will further strengthen our customer relationships, and will provide more predictable revenue streams over time.

Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017
During Fiscal 2018, our gross margin increased 55% to $20.1 billion, and our gross margin percentage increased 450 basis points to 25.5%.
These settlements are allocated to our segments based on the relative amount of affected vendor products sold by each segment.
In aggregate, these items totaled $10.2 billion and $8.4 billion for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
Our operating expenses include the impact of purchase accounting associated with the EMC merger transaction and, to a lesser extent, the going-private transaction, amortization of intangible assets, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses.
The increase in our total gross margin was primarily attributable to incremental gross margin of approximately $3.7 billion from the EMC acquired businesses, which had higher gross margin percentages.

The increases in SG&A expenses were primarily driven by incremental operating costs of the EMC acquired businesses.
Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016
Net Revenue — During Fiscal 2017, CSG net revenue increased 2%, driven by an increase in both commercial and consumer net revenue.
However, we are committed to a long-term growth strategy that we believe will benefit from the consolidation trends that are occurring in our markets.
See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information regarding VMware, Inc.'s acquisitions.
The increase in our deferred revenue was driven by a $2.2 billion increase in deferrals, primarily related to maintenance, extended warranty services, and the introduction of our flexible consumption model offerings.
Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met.
These provisions could have a material impact on our future effective income tax rate.
The increase in non-GAAP net income from continuing operations during Fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income, the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other, net expense.

Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below.
Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
While the EMC acquired businesses contributed higher gross margin overall, we experienced gross margin pressure in ISG related to the changing product mix within ISG as well as component cost inflation, particularly for memory components used in ISG products.
Cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion for Fiscal 2017 compared to $2.2 billion for Fiscal 2016.
We have securitization facilities to fund revolving loans and fixed-term leases and loans through consolidated special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs, which we account for as secured borrowings.
The increase in operating cash flows during Fiscal 2018 was driven by improved profitability, predominantly due to the incremental profitability from the EMC acquired businesses, and ongoing working capital initiatives.

(the "December 2016 Stock Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which VMware, Inc. agreed to repurchase for cash $500 million of shares of VMware, Inc. Class A common stock from a subsidiary of Dell Technologies.
For Fiscal 2019, U.S. Tax Reform also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction, and places limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense.

The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed.
The cumulative impact of any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined.
On October 31, 2017, we completed August 2017 Class V Group Repurchase Program, pursuant to which we repurchased 3.8 million shares of Class V Common Stock for $300 million.
This change was driven by a nine day improvement in DPO, which was primarily attributable to alignment of supplier payment terms as part of our ongoing integration efforts following the EMC merger transaction.
During Fiscal 2018, VMware, Inc. repurchased 1.4 million shares for $125 million pursuant to and in completion of the December 2016 Stock Purchase Agreement.

Cash Conversion Cycle
The following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle for the periods presented:
(d)We calculate our cash conversion cycle using non-GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of goods sold because we believe that excluding certain items from the GAAP results facilitates management's understanding of this key performance metric.
For the three months ended February 3, 2017, changes in our cash conversion cycle were unfavorable by 25 days when compared to the three months ended January 29, 2016.
We applied the proceeds from the sale to the repurchase of shares of our Class V Common Stock under the Class V Group Repurchase Program described above.
73
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred.
Each quarter, we reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our recorded accruals and allowance for doubtful accounts, and adjust the amounts as necessary.
Purchase Obligations — Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us.
Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
