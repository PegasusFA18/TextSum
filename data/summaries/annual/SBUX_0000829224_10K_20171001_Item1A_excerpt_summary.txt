You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. 

•Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. 

Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to Starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit and economic uncertainty. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. 

•Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results. 

We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. 

We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a company-operated store or a licensed store. 

Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. 

•Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. 

Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses), non-dairy alternative products (such as soymilk and almondmilk) and meats. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. 

Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. 

an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, potential imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. 

•The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. 

Our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems. For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability. 

These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. 

We continue to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. 

•We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and could adversely affect our financial results. 

Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our priority to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or 

ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. 

•We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 

These strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: 

•being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; 

•building our leadership position around coffee, including through the development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve stores; 

•driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities; 

•increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats; 

•moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; 

•creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; 

•continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business; and 

•delivering continued growth in our tea business through the Teavana brand in our Starbucks retail stores and other channels and internationally. 

In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could adversely impact our business and financial results, include the following: 

•increases in labor costs, both domestically and internationally, such as general market and minimum wage levels and investing in competitive compensation, increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs and other benefits to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, whether due to regulatory mandates, changing industry practices or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations; 

•increasing competition in channels in which we operate or seek to operate from new and existing large competitors that sell high-quality specialty coffee beverages; 

•continuing disruption in retail caused by on-line commerce, resulting in reduced foot traffic to “brick & mortar” retail stores; 

•consumers shifting categories of where they spend their discretionary income away from outside-the-home food and beverage; 

•construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; 

•not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; 

•the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovation; 

•lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Teavana brand in our Starbucks retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as mobile technology), or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced; 

•the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements; 

•not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses; and 

•the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. 

If our retail business partners do not provide sufficient 

If such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses, including their licensed stores, it could adversely affect our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores. 

Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our Channel Development business, grow our Teavana brand in our Starbucks retail stores and other channels, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. 

•We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. 

Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business, including from price discounting we may have to undertake. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. 

•We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment. 

If the Americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. and Canada markets, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. 

•We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. 

Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. In particular, both our China and Japan MBUs contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and CAP net revenues and earnings and China in particular is a significant market for our growth. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. 

Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. 

Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: 

•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; 

•changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; 

•interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; 

•restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; 

•import or other business licensing requirements; 

•the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; 

•limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; 

•in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; 

•difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; 

•local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; 

•delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and 

•disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets. 

Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. 

We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. These are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 

Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 

•Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. 

Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. 

•increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; 

•severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; and 

•especially in our larger or fast growing markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. 

•Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. 

Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability. 

We rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. These issues, especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers or vendors, could negatively impact our business and profitability. 

•Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. 

Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. 

•The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. 

Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. 

•Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. 

In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
