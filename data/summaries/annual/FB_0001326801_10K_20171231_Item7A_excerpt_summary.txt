Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation. 

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. 

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized foreign currency losses of $6 million, $76 million, and $66 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 

Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. 

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $611 million and $403 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements.
