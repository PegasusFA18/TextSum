We generated over 86% of total revenues from advertising in 2017.
The Supreme Court of Canada issued such a decision against Google in June 2017, and others could treat its decision as persuasive.
•Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country.
Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users.
Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
We rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts, and third party distributors, including cellular network carriers.
We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.
As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.
Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.
The GDPR will create a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including:
•increasing competition,
•changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix,
•the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels,
•the evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate, and
•the rate of user adoption of our products, services, and technologies.
In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux.
The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future.
If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
Furthermore, if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the Google brand, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.
The creation of Alphabet as a holding company in 2015 and the investments that we are making across various areas in Google and Other Bets are a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users.
Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.
Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.
As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.
Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data, or in our or our users’ ability to access such data, could seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users.
Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.
Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices.
•Court decisions that require Google to suppress content not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court, but for all of our users worldwide, including locations where the content at issue is lawful.
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock.
Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States.
We have in the past, and may experience in the future, supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers.
A variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages.
Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The areas where we face risks include, among others:
•Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis.
•Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.
We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly.
Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business.
International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2017.
Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services.
•Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.
As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into application in the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018, will apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users.
•The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.

Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users.
•The seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality.
The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile.
The share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.
•The perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.
•Our share repurchase program.
Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance.
In January 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional$8,589,869,056 of our Class C capital stock.
Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Alphabet (including an acquisition of Alphabet by another company).
Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management.
This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.
As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.
•Our stockholders may not act by written consent.
•Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors.
•Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting.
Alphabet’s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in its subsidiaries, including Google.
