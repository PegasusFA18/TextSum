While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.
In December 2017, the European Commission published a legislative proposal addressed to the European Parliament and Council for a new Directive and new Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms.
In addition, in November 2017, Treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the FSOC designates nonbanks as SIFIs, further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management.
In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.
In the event the SEC moves forward with any such proposals, any new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives could expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs and may require the Company to change how it operates its business and/or manages its funds.
Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds
As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency.
In the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs.
Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act.
The FCA supervises BlackRock’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements.
MiFID II may also impact the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions.
The substantive provisions of the rule began to apply in June 2017.

The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”.
The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock.
The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines.
The KID must include specific information on costs, risks and performance.
The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.
The SEC and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular.
Revised Department of Labor (“DoL”) Fiduciary Rule
In April 2016, the DoL proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers
In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), the requirement to establish anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to the FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”).

BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates.
Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region
In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations.
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors.
Revised EU Capital Requirements
EU regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for non-systemically important investment firms as the current regime is based upon banking requirements and has not been materially modified for asset managers.
The Proposed Rule would extend to those BlackRock subsidiaries captured within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock and its other affiliates or BlackRock’s stockholders.
Further, BlackRock will provide, without charge, upon written request, a copy of the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and all amendments to those filings as well as the committee charters, its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, its Code of Ethics for Chief Executive and Senior Financial Officers and its Corporate Governance Guidelines.
BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to an EU regulation on over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including since March 2017 the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties) and (iii) since 2014 the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA-registered or recognized derivatives trade repository.
Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”).
The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.
