MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and accompanying notes.
Business—Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and “Part I—Item 1A.
Certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
These drivers were partially offset by higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, as well as higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.
•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income was flat at $3.4 billion in 2016 as an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume was largely offset by:
◦higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and
◦lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016.
◦higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and
◦a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning.
The increase in valuation allowance was primarily driven by the reduction in federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.
Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate (35% for all periods presented), with offsetting reductions to the Other category.
60Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
◦Consumer Banking loan yield increased by 8 basis points to 6.3% in 2016 compared to 2015.
These drivers were partially offset by:
•higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth;
•lower marketing expenses; and
•operating efficiencies.
Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition.
Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.
Our provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by:
•higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and
•higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to growth.
Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.
•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $251 million to $1.4 billion in 2016 driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business.
These increases were partially offset by an allowance decrease in our commercial loan portfolio primarily driven by charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio, as well as reduced exposure and improved credit risk ratings in our oil and gas portfolio.
Table 11 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.
Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, $870 million and $1.0 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
◦higher losses in our auto loan portfolio due to changes in our charge-off practices for certain bankrupt accounts and growth; and
◦a greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio.
The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 67 basis points to 5.34% as of December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to higher auto delinquency inventories.
(3) Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, real estate owned (“REO”) and other foreclosed assets.
64Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Net loss from continuing operations recorded in the Other category was $1.6 billion in 2017 compared to net income of $165 million in 2016.
◦paydowns in our commercial and industrial loan portfolios;
◦charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio; and
◦the transfer of the substantial majority of our remaining taxi medallion lending portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.
**Change is not meaningful.
Table 7: Loans Held for Investment
Loans held for investment increased by $8.9 billion to $254.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, largely driven by loans obtained in the Cabela’s acquisition, as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for additional information.
We expect that a majority of the benefit from the Tax Act will be reflected in our earnings in the near term.
See “Part I—Item 1.
The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $196.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $142.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.
62Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
(4) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.
We are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment may have occurred.
We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile.”
 51Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Securitized Debt Obligations
Securitized debt obligations increased to $20.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily driven by securitized debt obligations assumed in the Cabela’s acquisition, partially offset by maturities outpacing issuances.
We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments.”
Table 8: Business Segment Results
 53Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
__________
(1) Total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.
The loss in 2017 was primarily driven by:
•charges associated with the estimated impacts of the Tax Act; and
•higher operating expenses associated with restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations, as well as the realignment of resources supporting our businesses.
We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment.
We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “MD&A—Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Note 4—Loans.”
Deposits
Our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations and provide a consistent source of low-cost funds.
Average loans held for investment increased by $12.5 billion to $65.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by the HFS acquisition and growth in our commercial loan portfolios.
When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
In comparison, we reported net income of $3.8 billion ($6.89 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $25.5 billion for 2016, and $4.1 billion ($7.07 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $23.4 billion for 2015.
The factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the Commercial Banking business.
Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 10.3% and 10.1% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $37.7 billion as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2016.
If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then the second step, which requires measurement of any potential impairment, must be performed.
The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.
In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast.
This bulletin states that the financial statements which include the reporting period in which the Tax Act was signed into law, should reflect the income tax impacts of the Tax Act for which the accounting under Topic 740 is complete.
Examples of U.S. government agencies include Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”).
We repurchased an immaterial amount of our common stock through the end of 2017 as part of the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.
This portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.
97Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Market Risk Measurement
We have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors.
Additionally, in December 2017, the Basel Committee finalized certain modifications to the international Basel III capital standards, which would require rulemaking in the United States prior to becoming effective for United States banking organizations.
49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Stockholders’ equity increased by $1.2 billion to $48.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to our net income of $2.0 billion in 2017, partially offset by $1.0 billion of dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders.
There is uncertainty regarding how any of the proposed changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches.
We continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.
(3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.
In December 2017, the Board of Directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remaining 2017 CCAR period, which ends June 30, 2018.
The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process.
The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions.
67Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates.
Our risk framework is supported with the right culture that promotes the foundation and values of the risk management organization.
The impacts of the Tax Act are considered to be reasonable estimates that are provisional in nature and are subject to potential adjustment during the measurement period ending no later than December 2018.
Through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decisions.
(5) Purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale, and excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.
The Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions.
The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $416 million to $576 million as of December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016.
On June 28, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018.
The total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, REO and other foreclosed assets.
These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis.
The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk exposure in our AOCI and capital ratios.
Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis.
61Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)
Table 11: Commercial Banking Business Results
(1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits.
The second line is both an “expert advisor” to the first line and an “effective challenger” of first line risk activities.
The first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks.
Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and when appropriate, the Board of Directors
Escalation is an important component of our risk framework.
Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action
While the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests and oversees first and second line risk taking.
We generally retained non-conforming mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit.
Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans.
At December 31, 2017, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement.
Fair Value
Fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives.
Trends in delinquency rates are one of the primary indicators of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, particularly in our credit card loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in credit losses.
Table 5 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions.
Table 25: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)
(1) Net charge-off (recovery) rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category.
Table 23: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest
(1) Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing delinquency amounts by period-end loans held for investment for each specified loan category, including PCI loans as applicable.
Management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization.
In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings.
While first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the Chief Risk Officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the Board of Directors.
These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter.
The Basel III Capital Rule also introduced the supplementary leverage ratio for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%.
If the Federal Reserve objects to the resubmitted capital plan, it may restrict subsequent capital distributions.
The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by adequately-capitalized institutions.
Legal Risk Management
The General Counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as Compliance and Internal Audit.
The Chief Operational Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our Operational Risk Management Program.
Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps.
Below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories.
Our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.
The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations.
Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
As of December 31, 2017, the countercyclical capital buffer was zero percent in the United States.
The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 741 million GBP and 786 million GBP as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 6.4 billion CAD and 6.2 billion CAD as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments
Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date.
Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees.
We review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis.
Losses are inherent in our loan portfolios and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolios with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses.
We measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our U.K. and Canadian operations.
Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $25.1 billion and $22.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(6) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.
We continue to service our existing home loan portfolio.
Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.
Limitations of Market Risk Measures
The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments.
(3) Other borrowings primarily consists of FHLB advances.
We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes.
Credit Risk Management
We try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns.
Our commercial banking loan portfolio is originated in most regions of the United States with a concentration in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as in Texas, California and Louisiana.

Table 26: Troubled Debt Restructurings
In the Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.
The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due.
Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.
The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference, or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans.
Investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
(3) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties.
Management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
Other assets includes repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans and the net realizable value of certain partially charged-off auto loans, which will continue to decline over time.
Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type.
Interest rate swaps are the most common type of derivative contract that we use in our asset/liability management activities.
