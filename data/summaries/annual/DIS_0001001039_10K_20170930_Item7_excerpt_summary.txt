Costs and expenses
Cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased 3%, or $0.7 billion, to $25.3 billion, due to higher sports programming costs, a full year of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and new guest offerings and inflation at our other parks and resorts.
Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable FX Impact.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit.
Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable FX Impact.
Charges in fiscal 2016 were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs.
Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.
These decreases were partially offset by growth in TV/SVOD distribution.
Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.
These increases were partially offset by a favorable Fiscal Period Impact.

Revenues
The decrease in licensing, publishing and games revenue was due to a 5% decrease from our games business, partially offset by a 4% increase from our merchandise licensing business.
The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to international growth and higher domestic rates, partially offset by a decrease due to a domestic sale of Star Wars Classic titles in the prior year.

The decrease in program sales was due to lower sales of cable and ABC programs.

Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows:

The Company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.
Higher revenue share with the Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment was due to the success of merchandise based on Star Wars: The Force Awakens in fiscal 2016, partially offset by lower sales of Frozen merchandise.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges

(2)Per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments
The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.
For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release.
A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2018 by approximately $263 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2017 by approximately $2.8 billion.
With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market.
Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.
The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue.
Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed.
The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.
The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts.
Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.
If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
Contingencies and Litigation
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.
If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.
If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
