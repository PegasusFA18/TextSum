As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. 

If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer. 

We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. 

We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. 

Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively. 

Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of our competitors. 

For additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Part I. 

Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations. 

The expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently, enhance and integrate our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. 

The introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or “ad-blocking” software or applications. 

Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable. 

Sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and ETLAs in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex. 

•the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment; 

•the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures; 

•the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services; 

•the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts; 

•the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers’ organizations; and 

•customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays. 

We spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter’s total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry. 

Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition. 

We generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which range from 1 to 36 months. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. 

Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. 

If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer. 

Our Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription based offerings pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the terms. 

Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. 

Security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business. 

We process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, most of which is hosted by third-party service providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this data. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. 

We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, use, transmit, and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation. 

Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm, costly and time intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business. 

Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. 

We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our services. 

Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability. 

U.S. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We also do business globally in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Globally, new laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers’ ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models effectively. These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. 

Transferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g. We are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the EU. Several other countries, including Australia and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. 

Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims. 

Security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach our data security systems and misused some of our systems and software in order to access our end users’ authentication and payment information. Maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. The costs to prevent, eliminate, notify affected parties of, or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. 

Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. This may result in litigation and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand and reputation. 

These problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing 

Further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time intensive notice requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. 

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management. 

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. 

•inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses; 

•difficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel of the acquired business; 

•entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; 

•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges; 

•inability to retain personnel of the acquired business; 

•inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business; 

•inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits; 

•incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results; 

•elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume; 

•increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business models; 

•additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational corporation; 

•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration; 

•impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services; 

•failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology; 

•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; 

•incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful; 

•inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective; 

•inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions; 

•the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections; 

•delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and 

Mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. 

Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. 

These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. 

For additional information regarding these updated standards, see the section titled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective” within Part II. 

Such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results. 

Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates. 

A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. 

Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. 

In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. 

to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. 

Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. 

The success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content. 

An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. The success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing customers and contributors. 

We face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation. 

As a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including: 

•international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad; 

•tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); 

•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 

•changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; 

•changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders; 

•failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately; 

•inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; 

•delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers; 

•the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business; 

•costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; 

•operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and 

•other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics. 

Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed. 

We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business. 

These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. 

Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. 

Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. 

If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. 

A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and affect our derivative counterparties. 

Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure. 

Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. In some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business. Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the U.S. 

The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. 

agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. 

We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights. 

We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business. 

We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure. 

We regularly review our program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 

Failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers’ requests could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results. 

Our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue. 

Failure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business. 

We contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. 

Successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. 

In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in 

economic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us. 

We also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. 

Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. 

We provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. 

Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline. 

A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as: 

•shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), sales of our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings, or other key performance metrics; 

•changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; 

•whether our results meet analysts’ expectations; 

•compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies; 

•the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our competitors; 

•the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers; 

•recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

•variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry; 

•general socio-economic, political or market conditions; and 

•unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. 

Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business. 

If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. 

Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. 

We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer. 

We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. 

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 

GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. 

We have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. 

We also have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. 

•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions; 

•requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and 

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. 

Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. 

In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. 

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. 

Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products. 

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. 

In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, we have the potential to experience losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. 

Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets. 

The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. 

Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns.
