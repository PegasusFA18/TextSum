These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events.
The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed.
If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property.
The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content.
With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.
Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.
The seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.
Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.
In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or United States anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses.

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law governed these operations.
For example:
•Our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products, new sources of broadband and mobile delivered content and internet usage.
•Our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.
•Our Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names.
Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations.
•Revenues in our Consumer Products & Interactive Media segments are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.
•Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S.
•Revenues in our Parks and Resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities.
