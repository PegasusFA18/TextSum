When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings.
We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $920 million and $950 million lower as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates.
