Substantially all of our business customers are initially under minimum-term contracts, which typically range from 2 to 5 years.
As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season.
Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 Super Bowl were reported in our Broadcast Television segment.
We primarily offer our enterprise service offerings to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our cable distribution footprint where we have agreements with other companies to use their networks to provide coverage outside of our service areas.
Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution and licensing of its programming and from the sale of advertising on its networks and digital properties.
High-Speed Internet
We offer high-speed Internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second (“Gbps”) and fiber-based speeds that range up to 2 Gbps.
The increases in revenue in both years were primarily due to rate adjustments and increases in the number of residential customers subscribing to additional services such as premium channels and advanced services, which accounted for substantially all of the increases in both 2017 and 2016.
Voice
We offer voice services that provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.
The primary drivers of the changes in operating costs and expenses were as follows:
2017
•An increase in programming expenses in our Cable Communications segment
•An increase in programming and production expenses in our Filmed Entertainment segment, partially offset by expenses in 2016 associated with our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics
•An increase in Corporate and Other activities driven by the launch of our wireless phone service
2016
•An increase in programming expenses in our Cable Communications segment
•Our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics, which was reported in our NBCUniversal segments
Operating costs and expenses for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Operating costs and expenses for our corporate operations, other businesses and business development initiatives is discussed separately below under the heading “Corporate and Other Results of Operations.”
Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2017 and 2016 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for software, in our Cable Communications segment in recent years.
Excluding $298 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics, distribution revenue increased 6.8% and 5.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the exhibition of a film in movie theaters, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases.
Video revenue increased 3.5% and 3.9% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(a)Charts exclude the results of NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other, Corporate and Other, and eliminations.
Cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers.
Content Licensing
Content licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks, and to subscription video on demand services.
Advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks’ programming schedules.
These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.
In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our On Demand service.
As of December 31, 2017, 45.2% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our high-speed Internet services, compared to 43.8% and 41.9% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We continue to invest to increase our network capacity and in customer premise equipment, primarily for our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways.
Other
Other investing activities in 2017 were primarily related to proceeds of $482 million received by NBCUniversal in the FCC auction for the relinquishment of spectrum rights (see Note 5 to Comcast’s consolidated financial statements and Note 4 to NBCUniversal’s consolidated financial statements).
From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.
Excluding $1.0 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics, advertising revenue decreased 2.3% in 2017 as the impact of continued declines in audience ratings were partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold.
The increase in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in spending on customer premise equipment and support capital.
Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national and local advertising markets, general economic conditions, cyclicality related to political campaigns and issue-oriented advertising, and the success and ratings of our programming.
Customers with minimum-term contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts.
Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased in 2016 primarily due to increased spending in 2015 for marketing of our NBC primetime lineup.

Programming and Production Costs
Programming and production costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms, and on-air talent costs.
These expenses increased in 2017 and 2016 primarily due to increases in employee-related costs.

Other
Other revenue primarily includes revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees.
Customer service expenses increased in 2016 primarily due to increased support for improving the customer experience and increases in total labor costs, which reflected sales and support activities associated with the deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways, and growth in business services and security and automation services.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Theme Parks segment revenue increased in 2016 compared to the pro forma combined revenue in 2015 primarily due to increases in guest spending and higher guest attendance driven by the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen.
Additionally, in 2017, we prospectively adopted certain provisions of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation which resulted in an increase in income tax benefit of $297 million (see Note 3 to Comcast’s consolidated financial statements).
The income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily driven by the enactment of new federal tax reform legislation in December 2017 (“2017 Tax Act”), partially offset by higher taxable income from operations.

We recorded expenses of $333 million that represented NBCUniversal’s proportionate share of The Weather Channel impairment charge.
We could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights.
A contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled.
We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our contractual obligations do not include certain expenditures related to the construction and development of the Universal Studios theme park in Beijing, China, as these commitments were not executed as of December 31, 2017.
