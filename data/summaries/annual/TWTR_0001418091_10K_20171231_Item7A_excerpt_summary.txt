QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. 

Our investment portfolio mainly consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 

A rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. 

In 2014, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.89 billion. However, the fair value of the Notes changes when the market price of our stock fluctuates or interest rates change. 

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, would negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. 

Net realized and unrealized foreign currency losses were $8.8 million in 2017. We currently utilize foreign currency forward contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our earnings may be adversely affected by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities net of our open hedge position, we estimated that a 10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollars would have resulted in a gain or loss of approximately $5.9 million as of December 31, 2017. 

We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation.
