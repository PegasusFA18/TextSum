ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and “Business.” 

Our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. The Under Armour Connected Fitness platform powers the world's largest digital health and fitness community and our strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. 

Our net revenues grew to $4,976.6 million in 2017 from $2,332.1 million in 2013. While we plan to continue to invest in growth, we also plan to improve efficiencies throughout our business as we seek to gain scale through our operations and return on our investments. 

Financial highlights for full year 2017 as compared to the prior year period include: 

•Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14%. 

•Gross margin decreased 140 basis points. 

A large majority of our products are sold in North America; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. 

We believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. We believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the United States, but are occurring in a number of markets globally, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers. 

In addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. Furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A. 

In addition to these charges, we also recognized restructuring related goodwill impairment charges of approximately $28.7 million for our Connected Fitness business. 

On February 9, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an additional restructuring plan (the "2018 restructuring plan") identifying further opportunities to optimize operations. 

•Up to $105.0 million in cash charges, consisting of up to: $55.0 million in facility and lease terminations and $50.0 million in contract termination and other restructuring charges; and 

•Up to $25.0 million in non-cash charges comprised of approximately $10.0 million of inventory related charges and approximately $15.0 million of intangibles and other asset related impairments. 

The United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affect us and, as required, we have included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate in our 2017 financial results. 

Net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and Connected Fitness revenues. Our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. 

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. Therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. 

We include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs were $101.5 million, $89.9 million and $63.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees’ function. We consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other, which includes our selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services categories. Our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. 

Other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 

The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues: 

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 

Net revenues increased $151.2 million, or 3.1%, to $4,976.6 million in 2017 from $4,825.3 million in 2016. 

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by: 

•Apparel unit sales growth in multiple categories led by men's and women's training and golf; and 

•Accessories unit sales growth in multiple categories led by men's training; and 

•Footwear unit sales growth in multiple categories led by running. 

This increase in license revenues was driven primarily by increased distribution of our licensed products in North America . 

Connected Fitness revenue increased $8.8 million, or 10.9%, to $89.2 million in 2017 from $80.4 million in 2016 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications and higher licensing revenue. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 140 basis points to 45.0% in 2017 compared to 46.4% in 2016. 

•an approximate 190 basis point decrease due to inventory management efforts including higher promotions and increased air freight; and 

•an approximate 20 basis point decrease due to our international business representing a higher percentage of sales; 

The above decreases were partially offset by: 

•an approximate 50 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs; and 

•an approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable channel mix with increased sales in our direct-to-consumer channel. 

With the exception of favorable product input costs and channel mix, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on 2018. 

As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 41.9% in 2017 from 37.8% in 2016. 

Income from operations decreased $389.6 million, or 93.3%, to $27.8 million in 2017 from $417.5 million in 2016. 

Interest expense, net increased $8.1 million to $34.5 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016. 

Other expense, net increased $0.9 million to $3.6 million in 2017 from $2.8 million in 2016. 

Provision for income taxes decreased $93.3 million to $38.0 million in 2017 from $131.3 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2016 primarily due to the significant decrease in income before taxes, the impact of tax benefits recorded on losses in the United States, and reductions in our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations during the current period. 

Our provision for income taxes in 2017 included $38.8 million of income tax expense as a result of the Tax Act, including a $13.9 million charge for our provisional estimate of the transition tax and $24.9 million for the provisional re-measurement of our deferred tax assets for the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. 

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 

Net revenues increased $862.0 million, or 21.8%, to $4,825.3 million in 2016 from $3,963.3 million in 2015. 

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by: 

•Apparel unit sales growth in multiple categories led by training, golf and basketball; and 

•Footwear unit sales growth, led by running and basketball. 

License revenues increased $15.6 million, or 18.6%, to $99.8 million in 2016 from $84.2 million in 2015. 

Connected Fitness revenue increased $27.0 million, or 50.6%, to $80.4 million in 2016 from $53.4 million in 2015 primarily driven by increased advertising and subscribers on our fitness applications. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 170 basis points to 46.4% in 2016 compared to 48.1% in 2015. 

•approximate 120 basis point decrease due to increased liquidation and discounting; 

•approximate 70 basis point decrease driven by negative sales mix primarily driven by the continued strength of our accelerated footwear growth; and 

•approximate 40 basis point decrease due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacting our gross margins within our business outside the United States. 

The above decreases were partially offset by: 

•approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs in our North America and international businesses; and 

•approximate 40 basis point increase driven primarily by lower air freight costs. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $326.1 million to $1,823.1 million in 2016 from $1,497.0 million in 2015. 

As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 9.9% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015. This increase was offset by lower incentive compensation expense for marketing employees. 

As a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 27.9% in 2016 from 27.2% in 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased investment for our factory house and brand house stores. 

Income from operations increased $8.9 million, or 2.2%, to $417.5 million in 2016 from $408.5 million in 2015. 

Interest expense, net increased $11.8 million to $26.4 million in 2016 from $14.6 million in 2015. 

Other expense, net decreased $4.4 million to $2.8 million in 2016 from $7.2 million in 2015. 

Our effective tax rate was 33.8% in 2016 compared to 39.9% in 2015. 

The net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following tables. 

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 

Net revenues by segment are summarized below: 

The majority of corporate expenses within North America have not been allocated to our other segments. 

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 

Net revenues by segment are summarized below: 

The increase in total net revenues was driven by the following: 

•Net revenues in our North America operating segment increased $549.6 million to $4,005.3 million in 2016 from $3,455.7 million in 2015 primarily due to the items discussed above in the Consolidated Results of Operations. 

•Net revenues in our EMEA operating segment increased $127.5 million to $330.6 million in 2016 from $203.1 million in 2015 primarily due to unit sales growth to wholesale partners in Germany and the United Kingdom. 

•Net revenues in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $123.7 million to $268.6 million in 2016 from $144.9 million in 2015 primarily due to our first e-commerce site in our direct to consumer channel and an increase in mono-branded partner stores which are included in our wholesale channel. 

•Net revenues in our Latin America operating segment increased $35.6 million to $141.8 million in 2016 from $106.2 million in 2015 primarily due an increase in company operated stores in our direct to consumer channel and partner doors in our wholesale channel. 

•Net revenues in our Connected Fitness operating segment increased $27.0 million to $80.4 million in 2016 from $53.4 million in 2015 primarily driven by increased advertising and subscribers on our fitness applications. 

Operating income (loss) by segment is summarized below: 

The increase in total operating income was driven by the following: 

In addition, this decrease reflects the movement of $11.1 million in expenses resulting from a strategic shift in headcount supporting our global business from our Connected Fitness operating segment to North America. 

•Operating income in our EMEA operating segment increased $8.3 million to $11.4 million in 2016 from $3.1 million in 2015 primarily due to sales growth discussed above and reductions in incentive compensation. 

This increase was offset by investments in our direct-to-consumer business and entry into new territories. 

•Operating loss in our Latin America operating segment increased $3.3 million to $33.9 million in 2016 from $30.6 million in 2015 primarily due to increased investments to support growth in the region and the economic challenges in Brazil during the period. 

•Operating loss in our Connected Fitness segment decreased $24.5 million to $36.8 million in 2016 from $61.3 million in 2015 primarily driven by sales growth discussed above. 

We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. 

The data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. All recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below: 

Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our new brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. 

These systems and processes, including our new global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. 

We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

In addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. 

At December 31, 2017, $158.7 million, or approximately 50.8%, of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the United States. 

We recorded a provisional tax liability of $13.9 million relating to the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. 

The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: 

Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. 

This decrease was partially offset by a smaller decrease in accounts receivable of $170.1 million. 

The increase in cash from operating activities was due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $325.4 million, an increase in net income of $24.4 million year over year and an increase in adjustments to net income for non-cash items of $1.1 million year over year. 

Cash used in investing activities decreased $98.2 million to $283.0 million in 2017 from $381.1 million in 2016, primarily due lower capital expenditures in 2017. 

Cash used in investing activities decreased $466.4 million to $381.1 million in 2016 from $847.5 million in 2015, primarily due to the impact of our Connected Fitness acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo which occurred during the first quarter of 2015. 

Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately $225.0 million. 

Cash provided by financing activities decreased $39.4 million to $106.8 million in 2017 from $146.1 million in 2016. 

Cash provided by financing activities decreased $235.3 million to $146.1 million in 2016 from $381.4 million in 2015. 

We are party to a credit agreement that provides revolving commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, as well as term loan commitments, in each case maturing in January 2021. 

Incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof, will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings. 

Up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. 

We are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. In February 2018, we amended the credit agreement to amend the definition of consolidated EBITDA, and to provide that our trailing four-quarter consolidated leverage ratio may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for the four quarters ended June 30, 2018, and 4.00 to 1.00 for the four quarters ended September 30, 3018. 

The applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the “Pricing Grid”) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted LIBOR loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. The weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings was 2.2% and 1.6% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. 

The proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. On or after March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

We incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the Notes. 

In December 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. The loan also requires prior approval of the lender for certain matters related to the property, including transfers of any interest in the property. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding balance on the loan was $40.0 million and $42.0 million, respectively. 

Interest expense, net was $34.5 million, $26.4 million, and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities. 

The leases expire at various dates through 2033, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after December 31, 2017 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table: 

(1)Includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of December 31, 2017, timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. 

(3)We generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. 

(4)Includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. Additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. 

The table above excludes a liability of $54.4 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. 

Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 

To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The SEC suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. We may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold. 

The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. Provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. 

In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination was made. 

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. We value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. 

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets 

Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, goodwill is impaired to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. 

We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, We review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. 

Deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. 

Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. 

Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future U.S. pre-tax earnings. In evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, we have considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following: 

•Availability of taxable income in the U.S. federal and certain state NOL carryback periods; 

federal NOLs have an indefinite carryforward period, beginning in 2018 pursuant to the Tax Act; 

•Definite lived tax attributes with relatively long carryforward periods; a majority from 10 to 20 years; 

•No history of U.S. federal and state tax attributes expiring unused; 

•Three year cumulative U.S. federal and state pre-tax income; 

•Relative low values of pre-tax income required to realized deferred tax assets relative to historic income levels; 

•Restructuring plans being undertaken to improve profitability; 

•Availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 

•Inherent challenges in forecasting future pre-tax earnings which rely on improved profitability from our restructuring efforts; 

•The continuing challenge of changes in the U.S. consumer retail business environment; 

•While relatively long, existence of definite lived tax attributes of certain U.S. federal tax credits and state NOLs; 

We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. 

Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. 

This unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been achieved as of December 31, 2017. 

In addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets are deemed probable, which requires management judgment. The achievement of certain revenue and operating income targets related to the performance-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2017 were not deemed probable as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 2 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. 

Refer to Note 2 to the notes to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. 

ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
