The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its operations. 

JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. 

Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations or losing a significant amount of revenue, and could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to: 

•limit the products and services that it offers 

•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities 

•stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue 

•recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds 

•pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges 

•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous 

•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or 

•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. 

Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business. 

The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, or other criteria. 

•larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation 

•financial technology companies and other competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or 

•the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that country. 

There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. 

•the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU 

•the separation of trading activities from core banking services 

•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives 

These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to, among other things: 

•divest assets or restructure its operations 

•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs 

•change the prices that it charges for its products and services 

•curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or 

•incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. 

Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability. 

Governments in some countries in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require that JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries which operate in those countries maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. 

Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations. 

JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. 

In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the settlement. 

•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or 

•other direct and indirect adverse effects. 

Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have increasingly demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. 

•JPMorgan Chase’s agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and 

•the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. 

Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including loss of clients, customers and business, the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently. 

JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. 

•enter into further orders and settlements 

•pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or 

•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses. 

The extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters. 

Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses. 

JPMorgan Chase is required under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit 

periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. 

After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. 

Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution. 

Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “holding company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the holding company were to enter into a resolution either: 

•in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or 

•in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”). 

If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company will absorb the losses of the holding company and its affiliates. 

The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the holding company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the holding company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the holding company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. 

Accordingly, in a resolution of the holding company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the holding company would realize value only to the 

extent available to the holding company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the holding company, under Title II. 

If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, none of the holding company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater. 

Political developments can cause uncertainty concerning the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. 

For example, the U.K.’s planned departure from the EU has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, will need to conduct their business in the U.K. and the EU. Recent elections and referendums in the U.S. and abroad have introduced uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms will operate in the future. 

JPMorgan Chase cannot predict political developments of this nature, or whether they will have favorable or unfavorable long-term effects on its businesses. 

Economic uncertainty caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses. 

The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to 

Certain policy proposals, including isolationist foreign policies, protectionist trade policies or the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for GSEs, could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets. 

•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets 

•heighten concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and 

•undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency. 

These factors could lead to greater market volatility, large-scale sales of U.S. government debt and other U.S. debt and equity securities, the widening of credit spreads and other market dislocations. 

Political developments in other parts of the world have also led to uncertainty in global economic conditions, including: 

•concerns about the capabilities and intentions of the government of North Korea, and 

•regional hostilities, and political or social upheavals, in other parts of the world. 

JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be adversely affected by the uncertainty arising from significant political developments and any market volatility or disruption that results from that uncertainty. 

The positive impact of U.S. tax reform legislation on JPMorgan Chase may diminish over time. 

While the tax reform will have a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase’s net income, the competitive environment and other factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions. 

JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following: 

•the liquidity in the U.S. and global financial markets 

•the level and volatility of market prices and rates, including those for debt and equity instruments, 

currencies, commodities, interest rates and other market indices 

•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets 

•the availability and cost of capital and credit 

•the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities 

•monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and 

•the health of the U.S. and global economies. 

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including: 

Sustained low growth in the U.S. economy could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity. 

JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers, including those relating to medical insurance, immigration and employment status, as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in, among other things, higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income. 

These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. 

deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses: 

•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions 

•dispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or 

•hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices. 

JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions. 

Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chase’s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. 

•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions 

•volatility in interest rates and debt, equity and commodities markets 

•changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and 

•the availability of liquidity in the capital markets. 

All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities. 

JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including: 

•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or 

•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument. 

If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses. 

JPMorgan Chase’s asset and wealth management and custody businesses may earn lower fee revenue during adverse macroeconomic conditions. 

The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing third-party assets or holding assets in custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. 

Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams. 

JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are high or increasing. 

•fewer originations of commercial and residential loans 

•lower returns on JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio, and 

•the loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior. 

Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. 

On the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause JPMorgan Chase’s net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce: 

•the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and 

•the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby reducing its net interest income and other revenues. 

When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. 

Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. 

High market volatility can impact JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses. 

While JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses may earn higher flow revenue during periods of elevated market volatility, sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities, loans, derivatives and other instruments can: 

•curtail the trading markets for those instruments 

•make it difficult to sell or hedge those instruments 

•increase JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs, or 

•adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, capital or liquidity. 

Furthermore, market participants that are not required to hold substantial amounts of capital may retreat more quickly from volatile markets, which could further reduce market liquidity. 

In a difficult or less liquid market environment, JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies. 

Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. 

JPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of its clients, customers and counterparties. 

Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. 

provide custody services for assets of JPMorgan Chase’s clients becomes insolvent. 

Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. 

JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant. 

JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. 

JPMorgan Chase’s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default. 

As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of various central counterparty clearinghouses (“CCPs”). JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. 

JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions. 

During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. 

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk. 

JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties: 

•do business in the same geographic region, or 

•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. 

This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its trading businesses. 

Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. 

For example, heightened competition among financial institutions for certain types of consumer loans, including credit card, mortgage, auto or other loans, could prompt significant reductions in the pricing of those loans and thereby decrease their profitability, or result in loans being extended to less-creditworthy borrowers. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment. 

Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. 

Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. 

Liquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase’s ability to fund and operate its businesses. 

JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as: 

•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices 

•default by a CCP or other significant market participant 

•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, and 

•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. 

A diminution of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. 

JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. 

•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements 

•continue to satisfy requirements under the TLAC rules concerning the amount of eligible LTD that JPMorgan Chase must have outstanding 

•address obligations under its resolution plan, or 

•satisfy regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities. 

More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities. 

and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). 

The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. 

As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

•pay interest on its debt securities 

•pay dividends on its equity securities 

•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and 

Collectively, these regulatory restrictions and limitations could significantly limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. 

Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding. 

Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including: 

•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. 

Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low. 

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including by: 

•materially increasing the cost of issuing and servicing securities 

•triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and 

•decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase. 

This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. 

Regulation and reform of benchmarks could have adverse consequences on securities and other instruments that are linked to those benchmarks. 

These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. 

Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks. 

This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. 

Any of the these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the manner of administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued by JPMorgan Chase or its subsidiaries. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, trading, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately and quickly. 

•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality of a particular operational system and other systems to which it transmits information, and 

•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure operational continuity. 

JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. 

The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of the operational systems of JPMorgan Chase or another significant market participant, including due to a cyberbreach, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including: 

•delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers 

•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets 

•the possibility that transactions such as funds transfers or capital markets trades are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences 

•financial losses, including possible restitution to clients and customers 

•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable 

•customer dissatisfaction and loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s products and services, and 

Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business. 

As the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions increases, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that: 

•errors, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption 

•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues 

•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, causes disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and 

•third parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights. 

If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of third parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected. 

JPMorgan Chase relies on the skill and integrity of its employees and those of third parties in running its operational systems. 

JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or 

misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or a third party. 

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with new products or processes. 

Any of these occurrences could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in: 

•potential liability to clients and customers 

•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions 

Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations. 

JPMorgan Chase’s connections to third-party operational systems expose it to greater operational risks. 

Third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, as well as retailers, data aggregators and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. 

If a third party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that third party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its customers, including: 

•heightened risk that third parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems 

•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations 

•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third party’s security breach, and 

•harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure. 

As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with customers and other third parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. 

JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. 

•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers 

•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s suppliers, counterparties and other third parties. 

Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can: 

•affect the development of new products or services 

•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and 

•require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. 

Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. 

•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or 

•intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. 

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause 

JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. 

JPMorgan Chase’s operations and results could be vulnerable to catastrophes or other events that disrupt its business. 

JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including: 

•cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises 

•failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets 

•damage to or loss of property or assets 

•natural disasters or severe weather conditions 

•events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. 

JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. 

•hinder its ability to provide services to its clients and customers 

•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption 

•cause it to incur financial losses, both from loss of revenue and damage to or loss of property, and 

•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. 

A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. 

JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. 

These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things: 

•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers 

•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or 

JPMorgan Chase has also been the target of significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services. 

JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. 

This is because, among other things: 

•the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched 

•cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and 

•third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase’s systems. 

The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications. 

A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a supplier, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including: 

•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems 

•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties or employees 

•damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties 

•inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions 

•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws 

•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients and customers 

•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity measures 

•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or 

JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees. 

JPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack. 

A successful breach of JPMorgan Chase’s computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things: 

•the breadth of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes 

•the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business 

•the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and 

•the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems. 

While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could 

further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack. 

JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase. 

However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified. 

JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to unexpected losses, and JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, by any inadequacy or lapse in its risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems. 

•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings 

•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions 

Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. 

These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. 

These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in 

the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. 

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses and face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations are inadequate. 

These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. 

•reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices 

•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes 

•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity 

•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology 

•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and 

•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations. 

JPMorgan Chase could incur substantial losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate. 

Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. 

Enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures. 

JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Specifically, any such failure could subject JPMorgan Chase to: 

•potential liability to clients and customers 

•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions 

Requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks. 

Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, market and operational losses. 

JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect. 

GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. 

•instruments in the investment securities portfolio 

Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. 

Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation. 

Any such lapses or deficiencies could: 

•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition 

•restrict its ability to access the capital markets 

•require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies 

•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions 

•otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. 

If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer. 

 JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. 

•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers 

•the geographies in which it operates 

•the types of clients and customers that it serves 

•the counterparties with which it does business, and 

•the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. 

The franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, and its earnings and results of operations, may suffer and revenues could decline if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that: 

•do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or 

•fail to address changing regulatory and market environments in the U.S. and abroad. 

Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. 

•devise effective business plans and strategies 

•effectively implement business decisions, including by minimizing bureaucratic processes 

•institute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities 

•offer products and services that meet the expectations of clients and customers, and in ways that enhance their satisfaction with those products and services 

•allocate capital to JPMorgan Chase’s businesses in a manner that promotes their long-term profitability 

•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or 

•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses. 

Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. 

Misconduct by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm its clients and customers, damage its reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action. 

All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. 

also important to JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes. 

Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities. 

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. 

•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services 

•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading 

•facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs 

•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers 

•violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices 

•making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and 

•misappropriating property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties. 

The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. 

•requirements that JPMorgan Chase restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities 

•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management 

•the undermining of JPMorgan Chase’s culture 

•loss of clients or customers, and 

Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses. 

Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects. 

•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or 

•regulatory investigations, enforcement actions or settlements. 

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business. 

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. 

Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. Furthermore, events that undermine JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can hinder its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. 

Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. 

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and 

JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to, among other things: 

•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest 

•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality 

•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations 

•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or 

•handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. 

In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. 

JPMorgan Chase can incur losses due to unfavorable economic developments around the world. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. For example, the Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. 

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and revenues are also subject to the risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. 

•negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions 

•the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which those companies operate, and 

•the other risks and considerations discussed below. 

Adverse economic and political developments in a country or region can have a wider negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses. 

These developments can also create market volatility which can lead to a contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond. Some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions. 

JPMorgan Chase’s business activities with governmental entities pose a greater risk of loss. 

These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may: 

•default on or restructure its obligations 

•claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or 

•repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. 

Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers. 

JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local political, social and economic factors. 

Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, 

Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including: 

•defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt. 

The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. 

These economic, political and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. 

If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. 

•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions 

•the adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations 

•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations 

•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and 

•the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies. 

JPMorgan Chase’s operations in or involving emerging markets countries can also be affected by governmental actions such as: 

•expropriation, nationalization or confiscation of assets 

•price, capital or exchange controls, and 

In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. 

JPMorgan Chase’s revenues from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations can be negatively affected by the foregoing economic, political and social conditions in a particular country in which it does business. 

JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the emerging markets can subject it to higher operational and compliance costs. 

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. 

Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks. 

JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. 

The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong and effective competitor. 

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. 

•trading, advisory and investment management firms 

•finance companies and technology companies, and 

•other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. 

JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. 

These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. 

Ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share. 

meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. 

Non-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. 

•prohibitions on engaging in certain transactions 

•making JPMorgan Chase’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and 

•adversely affecting JPMorgan Chase’s cost structure for providing certain products. 

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. 

JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. 

Changes in immigration policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. 

If immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected. 

JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory investigations. 

Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to JPMorgan Chase. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations. 

Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. 

If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. 

All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences.
