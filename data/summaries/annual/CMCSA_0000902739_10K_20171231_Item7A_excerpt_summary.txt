The effect of NBCUniversal’s interest rate derivative financial instruments was not material to NBCUniversal’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented.
Our interest rate derivative financial instruments, which may include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program.
As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, NBCUniversal enters into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of its foreign currency exposure for transactions denominated in other than the functional currency.
The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, NBCUniversal had foreign exchange contracts with a total notional value of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
We use cross-currency swaps for foreign currency denominated debt obligations when those obligations are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
