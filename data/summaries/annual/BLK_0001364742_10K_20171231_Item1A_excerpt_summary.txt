Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. 

Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. 

the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease; 

the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors; 

the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees; 

an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or 

a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital. 

The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors. 

BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, remove BlackRock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. 

Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth. 

The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are an important element of BlackRock’s competitive success. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. 

The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance. 

Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. 

Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings. 

At December 31, 2017, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.1 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. 

Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses. 

Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. 

BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default. 

Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2017 and subject to indemnification was $200 billion. 

BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. 

Increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the United States and abroad, as well as heightened security measures in response to these types of acts, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. 

Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of: 

client withdrawals in favor of better performing products; 

client shifts to products that charge lower fees; 

the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients; 

reduced, minimal or no performance fees; 

an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or 

a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital. 

Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings. 

Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on 

cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. 

Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships. 

BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. 

A failure in BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. In addition, despite BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions. 

A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. BlackRock’s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. 

There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock’s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock’s systems. 

In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. 

Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth. 

BlackRock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. 

The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients. 

Continuing enhancements to Aladdin’s capabilities, as well as the expansion of BlackRock’s Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, may expose BlackRock to heightened cyber- and information-security, operational and data management risks. 

Any failure by BlackRock to manage or mitigate risks related to enhancing or expanding its Aladdin platform may lead to client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may indirectly expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational and information security risks, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions. 

Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth. 

Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth. 

BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk. 

The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. 

Inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful. 

Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from inorganic transactions. 

Investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. 

Investments in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. 

construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment; 

accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control; 

failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws; 

exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection; 

environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants; 

changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities; 

the financial resources of tenants; and 

contingent liabilities on disposition of assets. 

These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. 

Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks. 

The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. 

The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. 

In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. 

Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships 

The impairment or failure of third parties may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the 

Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations. 

The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. 

Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. For example, BlackRock is currently in the process of moving custody services on more than $1 trillion of client assets from State Street Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., the migration of which is expected to be complete by the end of 2018. 

Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. 

Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange-Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility. 

BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value. While an ETF’s creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the ETF’s net asset value, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the ETF’s net asset value. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an ETF’s net asset value, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world. 

These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. To the extent that these rules and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company’s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted. 

Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. 

For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.” 

Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. 

BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation,” key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include: 

Designation as a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”): The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs. In addition, in November 2017, Treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the FSOC designates nonbanks as SIFIs, further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management. 

In so doing, it has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain U.S. registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. These rules, many of which are currently in an implementation period, will increase BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth. 

The Volcker Rule: Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. 

Revised Department of Labor (“DOL”) Fiduciary Rule: In April 2016, the DoL published a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the applicability date of many conditions of the prohibited transaction exemptions accompanying the rule has been delayed until July 2019, while the DoL continues its re-examination of the rule and the prohibited transaction exemptions. 

Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. 

International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. 

BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of pending regulatory reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including: 

The outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU in connection with Brexit is highly 

The Company continues to prepare for a range of potential outcomes in connection with Brexit. 

Any measures applied in relation to a G-SIFI designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities. 

Reform of EU investment markets: The European Commission has revised the Directive governing the provision of investment services in Europe (“MiFID”) and introduced an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms may impact BlackRock’s product development, client servicing and distribution models. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, are substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements and enhancing protections afforded to investors. MiFID II may also impact the ability of certain of BlackRock’s distribution partners to accept commissions. 

In December 2017, the European Commission published a legislative proposal addressed to the European Parliament and Council for a new Directive and new Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The new legislative package is currently expected to come into effect in 2020 following agreement between the European Council and Parliament. 

EU market access: The European Commission and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for “equivalence”, which is the process by which the legal, regulatory and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognized by the European Commission as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing such non-EU Member States access to the EU single market in financial services. If enacted, the proposal would transfer to ESMA the ability of EU Member States to authorize the outsourcing of asset management activities beyond the EU’s borders. 

EU money market fund reform: In November 2016, the EU council announced political agreement with the European Parliament on certain money market funds reforms that are intended to reduce perceived risks associated with these products. BlackRock is evaluating the reforms and potential impact to its existing constant net asset value money market funds. 

BlackRock is required to produce a KID for each fund in scope, as well as to make information available to distribution partners who sell these funds in the EU. 

In the event that BlackRock or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose fines and/or sanctions. 

International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. 

These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. 

A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts. 

As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. 

BlackRock is subject to U.S. banking regulations that may limit its business activities. 

The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank. In addition, as described in “Item 1-Business-Regulation”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. The Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. 

Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership. 

Although there is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments, some commentators have proposed policy measures in connection with the discourse in this area, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and escalating executive compensation, among other things. 

New tax legislation or changes to existing U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition. 

Over the next few months, as the Company finalizes the impact of tax reform and clarifies the potential for future investment opportunities, BlackRock intends to reassess its capital management plans for the balance of 2018. 

If introduced as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results. 

The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. 

RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER 

PNC owns 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. 

As of December 31, 2017, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. 

PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC. 

This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. 

As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, pursuant to BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office: 

•appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock; 

any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than the persons holding such majority of the total voting power prior to the occurrence of any such merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock; 

any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition; 

any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis; 

except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase; 

•any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or 

•any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 

Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC: 

any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis; 

for so long as BlackRock is deemed a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the Bank Holding Company Act; 

any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC; 

any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or 

• a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock. 

The Company has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff relating to BlackRock’s periodic or current reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.
