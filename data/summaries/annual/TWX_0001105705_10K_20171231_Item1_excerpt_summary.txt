Machinima (acquired by Warner Bros. in 2016), a global aggregator of gaming and related content aimed at audiences that play Warner Bros. games and watch its films and television programming, is also part of the division. 

Warner Bros. is focused on maintaining its leadership position in producing primetime series for the U.S. broadcast networks (including The CW broadcast network (The CW)) while increasing production of high-quality original series for basic cable networks (including TNT and TBS, which are airing four Warner Bros. series for the 2017-2018 television season), premium pay television services (including HBO) and OTT services (including Warner Bros. and Turners Boomerang-branded SVOD service).

Warner Bros. produces and distributes its television programming for initial airing on broadcast and basic cable television networks, premium pay television and OTT services and local television stations in the U.S. Warner Bros. also produces and distributes short-form live-action series and animated programming for initial viewing on digital platforms. 

These licenses enable Warner Bros. to generate significant revenues from hit television series for years beyond their initial airing on television. 

Warner Bros. also licenses its feature films to premium pay television services (including HBO), broadcast and cable networks and OTT services starting approximately eight to nine months following their theatrical release. 

Warner Bros. licenses rights to exhibit feature films to SVOD services in China, and feature films and original television series to HOOQ, an SVOD service operating in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, which is owned by Warner Bros., Singtel Telecommunications Limited and Sony Pictures Television. 

As the worldwide demand for locally produced, local-language programming increases, Warner Bros. is focused on expanding its international local-language production business. 

The revenues generated by Warner Bros. television business consist of (1) fees for the initial broadcast of Warner Bros. television programming on U.S. broadcast and cable television networks and premium pay television and OTT services, (2) fees for the airing or other distribution of its television programming after its initial broadcast in secondary U.S. distribution channels (such as basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services), (3) fees for the international distribution of Warner Bros. television programming for free-to-air television, basic tier television services, premium pay television services and OTT services, and (4) revenues from the sale of the television programming of Warner Bros. and other companies in physical and digital formats.

Consumer spending on film and television content in higher margin digital formats represents an increasing share of total home entertainment consumer spending in recent years, but has not meaningfully offset declines in consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats. 

For example, in 2017, Warner Bros. joined four other major film studios to launch the Movies Anywhere service in the U.S., which enables consumers to access digital copies of their films through a variety of digital platforms. Warner Bros. licenses its newly released feature films as well as films from its library and its television content to EST and transactional VOD services for viewing online and on mobile platforms in the U.S. and internationally. 

Although consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats has declined in recent years, the distribution of home entertainment product in physical formats still generates significant revenues for Warner Bros.

The CW does not require any login or authentication of a cable subscription to stream its content. 

The Companys businesses operate in highly competitive industries, and the environment in which the Company competes has become more challenging over the past few years due to the shifts in consumer viewing patterns described above, increased competition from OTT services and the expansion by other companies, in particular technology companies, into 

Competition in these industries has intensified as leisure and entertainment options have proliferated and audience fragmentation has increased. The Companys businesses compete for consumers entertainment and leisure time and spending with each other, as well as other forms of entertainment, including other television networks, premium pay television services, local over-the-air television stations, social media platforms and other OTT services, motion pictures, home entertainment products and services, games, print media, live events, radio broadcasts and other forms of news, information and entertainment, as well as pirated content. 

The Companys competitive position is greatly affected by the quality of, and public response to, its content. The Companys businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers, directors, writers, actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties. 

The Company also faces competition for the licensing and distribution of its programming. The Company also faces competition from other television networks and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates. 

The Companys advertising-supported television networks and digital properties compete for advertisers spending with advertising-supported OTT services, other networks and digital properties, print, radio, outdoor display and other media. 

The Companys businesses also compete in their character and brand merchandising and other licensing activities with other licensors of characters and brands. 

The Companys businesses are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the laws and regulations of other countries and international bodies such as the European Union (the EU), and these laws and regulations are subject to change, including due to regulatory reform measures. 

Time Warner is one of the worlds leading creators, owners and distributors of intellectual property. 

To protect the Companys intellectual property, the Company relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent and trade secret laws and license agreements. 

In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. The Company also relies on laws that prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures and trafficking in circumvention devices. In the U.S., the usual copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years, and the copyright term for works made for hire is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from the date the work was created. 

Piracy, particularly of digital content, continues to present a threat to the Companys revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. The Company vigorously pursues appropriate avenues to protect its intellectual property, including sending takedown notices in appropriate circumstances and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement against websites that distribute or facilitate the unauthorized distribution of the Companys content. 

In July 2015, the EC sent a Statement of Objections to a number of U.S. film studios, including Warner Bros., reflecting its preliminary view that such contractual provisions may violate EU competition rules prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. The investigation has focused on contractual restrictions that prevent broadcasters in one EU country from selling subscriptions in response to unsolicited requests from viewers in other EU countries. The outcomes of the ongoing EC investigation and legislative and regulatory proceedings in the EU are difficult to predict, and thus it is not possible to determine the impact they could have on the Companys businesses. In January 2016, the EC held a hearing on the matter. Separately, in 2015, the EC published its Digital Single Market strategy, which includes a broad range of high-level proposals that are intended to promote access to online services and entertainment content across national borders within the EU to foster the creation of a single digital market in the EU. 

Regulation Relating to Data Privacy, Data Security and Cybersecurity 

For example, in the U.S., the Company is subject to: (1) the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which applies to certain of the Companys websites, mobile apps and other online business activities and restricts the collection, maintenance and use of personal information regarding children; (2) the Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which imposes privacy and security requirements on the Companys health 

 plans for its employees and on service providers under those plans; (3) the Video Privacy Protection Act, which restricts disclosure of video viewing information; (4) state statutes requiring data security controls and notice to individuals when personally identifiable information (PII) has been accessed or acquired in a data breach; and (5) privacy and security rules imposed by the payment card industry, as well as regulations designed to protect against identity theft and fraud in connection with the collection of credit and debit card payments from consumers. 

In the U.S., for example, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) frequently issues guidance that sets forth best practices for businesses to build privacy protections into their products and provide consumers greater control over the collection and use of their personal information. 

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, for example, is intended to promote voluntary sharing of information regarding cybersecurity threats and defensive measures undertaken in response to those threats with the government and other businesses. 

For example, California law requires operators of commercial websites and online services (including mobile apps) to make disclosures about how the operator or other parties may collect PII about a consumers online activities, including in some cases disclosure of how the operator responds to Web browser do not track signals or other mechanisms that enable consumers to opt out of the collection of such information. 

The EC adopted a data directive in 1995 to protect the privacy rights of individuals within the European Union and the transfer of personal information outside the EU (the Directive). A replacement framework called the EU  U.S. Privacy Shield (the Privacy Shield framework), which replaces the Safe Harbor framework, was formally approved by the EC in July 2016. The Privacy Shield framework imposes greater obligations on U.S. companies to protect personal data transferred from the EU to the U.S. and requires the U.S. Department of Commerce and the FTC to carry out stricter monitoring and enforcement. data transfer requirements to be able to continue to operate its businesses. 

The GDPR is intended to support the Digital Single Market strategy within the EU by providing a single set of rules on data protection across the European Economic Area, while enabling individuals to better control their personal data. 

Regulation of Television Networks, Internet/Broadband Services, Programming and Advertising 

In the U.S., cable networks and premium pay television services, either directly or indirectly through their distribution partners, are subject to various 

 obligations under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and related regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC). 

The net neutrality regulations subject ISPs to the requirements of Title II of the Communications Act, including imposing limitations on unreasonable practices, obligations regarding customer privacy and protections for people with disabilities and authorize the FCC to investigate and act on consumer complaints. ISPs generally are permitted to engage in reasonable network management (other than paid prioritization) if the purpose of their actions is related to managing their network. However, in December 2017, under a new chairman, the FCC adopted a declaratory ruling, report, and order (the 2017 Order) (the date on which it will be fully effective has not yet been determined) that reverses application of Title II to ISPs and eliminates most of the specific conduct restrictions on ISPs established through the 2015 Order. Petitions for review by the U.S. Supreme Court remain pending. In addition, members of Congress have introduced legislation that would set forth a new net neutrality regulatory framework and lawmakers in several states have introduced bills that would prohibit ISP actions to block or slow down sites or online services. 

The proposed rules would also prohibit contract provisions that restrict a programming providers ability to distribute its programming through alternative video distribution platforms, including online platforms. It is not possible to predict what, if any, impact any such rules could have on the Companys negotiations with multichannel video programming distributors. 

From time to time, the FCC also conducts inquiries and rulemaking proceedings, which could lead to additional regulations that could have a material effect on the Companys businesses. 

The FCC is engaged in a number of proceedings designed to make more of the electromagnetic spectrum that is currently used for broadcast television and satellite distribution available for wireless broadband or other uses. It may take several years for these proceedings and any related spectrum reallocation to be completed, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any such proceedings and reallocation could have on the Company. 

The FCC changed its television closed captioning rules 

These new rules, which generally have not yet taken effect pending further procedural requirements, will increase the captioning compliance obligations of video programmers such as the Company. 

Pursuant to the Accessibility Act, in July 2017, the FCC adopted rules that, beginning in July 2018, will increase the number of hours of audio descriptions of video content required to be provided by certain video distributors. 

Under the FCCs rules, video clips that contain a single excerpt of a captioned television program with the same video and audio that was shown on television (straight lift clips) must be captioned, and, beginning in January 2017, the rule was expanded to apply to newly posted video clips that contain compilations of straight lift clips containing content previously shown on television with captions. These rules increase the costs of making video clips available online. 

Various other federal laws also contain provisions that place restrictions on violent and sexually explicit programming. 

In international territories, there are various laws and regulations relating to the distribution or licensing of television programming and other products. For example, the EU Audio Visual Media Services directive, which allows EU member states to adopt more restrictive regimes and applies to all programs produced after December 2009, obligates broadcasters to notify viewers if an audiovisual program contains paid product placement, bans any form of product placement in childrens and news programming and prohibits product placement of tobacco products and prescription medication. In May 2016, the EC proposed an amendment to the directive to require that the rules implemented under the directive by EU member states are applied consistently across various platforms, including traditional broadcast networks, VOD providers and video-sharing platforms. The Council of the EU and the European Parliament are reviewing the legislative proposal. Finally, several governments, including in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico and Uruguay, have recently proposed, enacted or more strictly enforced regulations that limit the amount of advertising content that can be aired on television networks. 

Regulation of the Distribution and Licensing of Feature Films 

In countries outside the U.S., there are a variety of laws and regulations relating to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks. In certain countries, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year. 

Certain marketing activities are also subject to specific federal statutes and rules, such as COPPA and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA), which restricts certain telephone calls, faxes or mobile text messages to consumers without their prior consent. Both the TCPA and CASL provide for private rights of action, and violations of these laws can result in potential liability, including substantial administrative fines and class action lawsuits.
