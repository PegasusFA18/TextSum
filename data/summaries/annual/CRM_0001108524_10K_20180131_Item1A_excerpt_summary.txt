The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 

If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. 

Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers’ data, our data or our IT systems. 

Our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem and, as illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats, if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, a security breach could occur. In addition, our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems. 

In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our servers. 

A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. 

Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. 

Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. 

Any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. 

We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. 

We use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. 

Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. 

If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. 

Privacy concerns and laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. 

These new laws may require us to make changes to our services to enable Salesforce and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. 

If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. 

Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. 

Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. 

Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. The markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. 

Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. 

If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. 

As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. 

As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. 

•potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; 

•difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; 

•diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; 

•the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; 

•potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; 

•potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; 

•inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; 

•inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; 

•difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; 

•augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; 

•increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; 

•potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; 

•unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; 

•negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; 

•additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; 

•delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; 

•ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; 

•challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures; 

•currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and 

•the tax effects of any such acquisitions. 

In addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability 

to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. 

Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. 

Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. 

Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. For example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. 

Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. 

We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. 

We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. 

Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. 

The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. 

Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current 

Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. 

•Vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; 

•Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; 

•Internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers’ IT departments); 

•Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; 

•E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; 

•Traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services; 

•IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and 

•Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. 

In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. 

Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. 

The Internet’s infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. 

These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate Internets. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. 

These actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet Service Providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. 

We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. 

The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are 

If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary impairment, which could be material. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results and may harm our business and cause our stock price to decline. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. 

Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. 

The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. 

Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: 

•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements; 

•the attrition rates for our services; 

•the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; 

•the length of the sales cycle for our services; 

•new product and service introductions by our competitors; 

•our success in selling our services to large enterprises; 

•our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; 

•general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; 

•variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings; 

•changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; 

•changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; 

•changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; 

•the seasonality of our customers’ businesses, especially Commerce Cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; 

•changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the British Pound; 

•the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; 

•the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; 

•the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; 

•the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; 

•expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; 

•timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; 

•expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; 

•extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; 

•income tax effects, including the impact of changes in U.S. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; 

•the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; 

•technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; 

•changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; 

•conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; 

•changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage public and privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; 

•equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; 

•the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; 

•evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; 

2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”), which includes the accounting for revenue recognized and capitalized costs. 

If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. 

If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. 

We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. 

Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations. 

We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. 

•localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; 

•regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; 

•pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; 

•evolving domestic and international tax environments; 

•liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; 

•foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; 

•compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; 

•regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers’ data across international borders; 

•treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; 

•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

•different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; 

•longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; 

•natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and 

Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 

Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. 

As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. 

If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. 

In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. 

Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. 

If customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. 

If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. 

Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers 

In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies and the Euro versus the Pound Sterling. 

We conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. 

As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. 

In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. 

Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. 

Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. 

We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. 

We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. 

The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. 

have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. 

Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. 

For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. 

Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. 

Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. 

Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. 

If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. 

We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. 

Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. 

We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising from these facilities could adversely impact our 

If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. 

We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. 

We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 

As our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees’ workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. 

Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. 

We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. 

Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. 

In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. 

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. 

Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. 

We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. 

Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, and changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. As we further analyze the new law, and collect relevant 

Any changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities. 

We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. 

Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. 

Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: 

•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; 

•cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; 

•make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and 

•due to limitations within the revolving credit facility and term loan covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. 

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. 

A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings. 

New lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. 

Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. 

In addition, geopolitical developments can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers’ 

purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. 

Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. 

Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. 

Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. 

Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to resume operations. 

Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. 

Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. 

We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. 

We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results 

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. 

Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. 

Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock 

The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. 

Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. 

•variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, both billed and unbilled, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and Einstein predictions, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; 

•variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; 

•forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue and earnings per share; 

•changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; 

•announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 

•announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; 

•announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; 

•the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; 

•recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

•disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; 

•the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; 

•trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; 

•the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and 

•issuance of debt or other convertible securities. 

The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. 

We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. 

We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. 

We may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. 

In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. 

In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. 

The fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. 

The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. 

The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. 

We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. 

The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. 

We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. 

We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. 

The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. 

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. 

•permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; 

•provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; 

•require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; 

•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”); 

•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

•provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and 

•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. 

In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.
