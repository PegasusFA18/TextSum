In 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open Internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act.

The FCC’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband Internet access service as an “information service” has the effect of reinstating the FTC’s authority to regulate ISPs’ privacy protections and their use and disclosure of certain customer information.
In addition, Congress may consider legislation addressing these regulations and the classification of broadband Internet access services and legislators in numerous states have stated that they will introduce legislation to impose Open Internet protections in a variety of ways.
In late 2017, the FCC adopted an order relaxing the broadcast media ownership rules and is considering additional revisions to the rules, which could lead to further broadcast television station consolidation.
In December 2017, the FCC adopted an Order eliminating Title II regulation of broadband Internet access service, as well as its prior no-blocking, no-throttling, no paid-prioritization and general conduct rules, stating that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the FTC.
