The Salesforce Platform enables customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps.
We provide a set of application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solutions with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions.
Ease of integration and configuration.
We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our services to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively considering, among other things, the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which assembles standards, guidelines and practices.
Positive environmental impact.
Our multi-tenant cloud computing model has a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional Information Technology ("IT") hardware and software.
To meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we also provide solutions for Financial Services, Healthcare and Government.
