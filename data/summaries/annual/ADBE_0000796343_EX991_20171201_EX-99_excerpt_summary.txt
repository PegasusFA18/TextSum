During fiscal year 2018, Adobe expects quarterly revenue, earnings per share and Digital Media ARR results to follow similar seasonality as was achieved in fiscal year 2017.
The following table shows Adobe's first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings per share and tax rate targets reconciled to non-GAAP targets included in this document.
Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and certain activity in connection with technology license arrangements, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.
