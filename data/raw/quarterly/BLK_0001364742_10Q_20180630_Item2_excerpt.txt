(4)   

Results for 2017 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. For further information, refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017  

GAAP. Operating income of $1,440 million increased $203 million and operating margin of 39.9% increased 170 bps from the second quarter of 2017. Operating income and operating margin growth primarily reflected higher base fees, higher performance fees and higher technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense.  

Second quarter 2018 income tax expense reflected a reduced tax rate associated with The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information. 

Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.42, or 27%, from the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher operating income, a lower tax rate and the benefit of share repurchases.  

As Adjusted. Operating income of $1,443 million increased $202 million from the second quarter of 2017, and operating margin of 45.2% increased 130 bps from the second quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted common share increased $1.44, or 28%, from the second quarter of 2017. 

45 

SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 

GAAP. Operating income of $2,815 million increased $435 million and operating margin of 39.2% increased 160 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2017. Operating income and operating margin growth primarily reflected higher year-over-year base fees, performance fees, and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits, higher volume-related expense, and higher general and administration expense. Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), decreased $25 million driven by lower net gains on investments. Nonoperating results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included a “make-whole” redemption premium of $14 million related to the refinancing of $700 million of 6.25% notes, which were repaid prior to their September 2017 maturity.  

Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 reflected a reduced tax rate associated with the 2017 Tax Act and included a discrete tax benefit of $58 million related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2018. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included a discrete tax benefit of $81 million related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2017. See Income Tax Expense within Discussion of Financial Results for more information.  

Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.89 to $13.30, or 28%, from the six months ended June 30, 2017, driven primarily by higher operating income, a lower tax rate and the benefit of share repurchases.  

As Adjusted. Operating income of $2,821 million increased $433 million and operating margin of 44.7% increased 140 bps from the six months ended June 30, 2017. Earnings per diluted common share increased $2.91, or 28%, from the six months ended June 30, 2017. 

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP“).  

For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.  

46 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:  

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. 

•  

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. 

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.  

47 

(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items and charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. 

See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.  

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.  

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.  

48 

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  

AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

Cash management AUM increased to $457.1 billion, driven by positive net inflows, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.  

AUM decreased $87.5 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, largely against the British pound, the Euro, and the Japanese yen.

AUM increased $11.5 billion to $6.3 trillion at June 30, 2018, driven by positive net inflows, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and net market depreciation. 

Net market depreciation of $26.8 billion was primarily driven by lower U.S. and global equity markets. 

Long-term net inflows of $69.1 billion were comprised of net inflows of $52.4 billion and $22.2 billion from iShares ETFs and retail clients, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $5.5 billion from institutional clients. Net flows in long-term products are described below.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Retail net inflows of $22.2 billion reflected net inflows of $17.0 billion in the United States and $5.2 billion internationally. Retail net inflows were led by fixed income net inflows of $16.3 billion, reflecting inflows into emerging markets, municipal bond funds, and unconstrained strategies. 

•

•  

Institutional index net outflows of $3.1 billion were primarily driven by equity net outflows of $28.1 billion, linked to asset allocation, re-balancing and cash needs, partially offset by fixed income net inflows of $24.7 billion, led by continued demand for liability-driven investment fixed income solutions.  

Cash management AUM increased 2% to $457.1 billion, driven by positive net inflows, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW  

As Adjusted Balance Sheet  

The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs.  

The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements  

Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the condensed consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.  

In addition, the Company records on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.  

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds  

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities (“VREs”) and VIEs, (collectively, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2017 Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.  

64 

The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)   

Amounts represent segregated client assets generating advisory fees in which BlackRock has no economic interest or liability.  

(2)   

Amounts primarily represent the portion of assets and liabilities of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds attributable to NCI.  

(3)   

Amounts include property and equipment and other assets.  

(4)  

Amount includes approximately $3.9 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles.  

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.  

Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included $70 million and $63 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated VREs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2018).  

Accounts receivable at June 30, 2018 decreased $132 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to lower performance fee receivables. Investments were $1,813 million at June 30, 2018 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $27 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including property and equipment) increased $154 million from December 31, 2017, primarily related to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities) and earnings from certain strategic investments. 

65 

Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at June 30, 2018 decreased $968 million from December 31, 2017, primarily due to 2017 incentive compensation cash payments in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by 2018 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at June 30, 2018 increased $55 million from December 31, 2017.  

Other liabilities increased $187 million from December 31, 2017, primarily related to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets) and other operating liabilities.  

Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs  

The Company’s investments and investments of consolidated VIEs (collectively, “Total Investments”) were $1,813 million and $1,883 million, respectively, at June 30, 2018. Total Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs and VIEs. Management reviews BlackRock’s Total Investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of Total Investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

The Company presents Total Investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of Total Investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.  

The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of Total Investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Amount includes $285 million of carried interest (VIEs) as of June 30, 2018 and $266 million as of December 31, 2017, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. 

66 

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other alternatives include direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions. 

(2)  

Other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as U.K. government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes.  

As adjusted investment activity for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was as follows:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds 

The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.  

The following table presents a reconciliation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.  

For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. 

Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.  

Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $63 million and primarily reflected $203 million of investment purchases and $63 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $191 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.  

Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,003 million, primarily resulting from $1,040 million of share repurchases, including $635 million in open market transactions and $405 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $969 million of cash dividend payments.  

68 

The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)   

The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries was approximately 55% and 40% at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. 

(2)   

The Company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.  

(3)  

Amount does not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.  

Total liquidity resources decreased $302 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily reflecting cash payments of 2017 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1,040 million and cash dividend payments of $969 million, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities.  

A significant portion of the Company’s $3,055 million of Total Investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.  

Share Repurchases. The Company repurchased 1.2 million common shares in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $635 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, there were 5.2 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.  

Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.  

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.  

Short-Term Borrowings  

2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4.0 billion and was amended in April 2018 to extend the maturity date to March 2023 (the “2018 credit facility”). The 2018 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2018 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2018 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The 2018 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At June 30, 2018, the Company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.  

Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2018 credit facility. At June 30, 2018, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 

69 

Long-Term Borrowings  

At June 30, 2018, the principal amount of long-term borrowings outstanding was $5.0 billion. See Note 12, Borrowings, in the 2017 Form 10-K for more information on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.  

During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company paid approximately $93 million of interest on long-term borrowings. Future principal repayments and interest requirements at June 30, 2018 were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

__________________________ 

 (1)  

The amount of principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes (issued in Euros) represents the expected payment amounts using foreign exchange rates as of June 30, 2018. 

Commitments and Contingencies  

Investment Commitments. At June 30, 2018, the Company had $320 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated VIEs. These funds include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.  

Lease Commitment. In May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with 50 HYMC Owner LLC, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New York. The term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in May 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. The lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term).  

Acquisition. In November 2017, the Company announced that it had entered an agreement to acquire the asset management business of Citibanamex, a subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Consideration for the transaction will include an upfront cash payment of $350 million and contingent consideration. 

Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions. In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at June 30, 2018 totaled $223 million, and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  

70 

Carried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in Total Investments, or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated VIEs on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock’s condensed consolidated statements of income when the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.  

Indemnifications. On behalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement. At June 30, 2018, the Company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $213 billion. The Company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $227 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at June 30, 2018. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at June 30, 2018.  

While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements, including information regarding the adoption of ASU 2014-09. In addition, see Critical Accounting Policies in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2017 Form 10-K for further information.  

Consolidation. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. See Note 5, Consolidated Voting Rights Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary (“PB”) of the entity.  

71 

At June 30, 2018, BlackRock was determined to be the PB for certain investment funds that were determined to be VIEs, which required BlackRock to consolidate them. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Variable Interest Entities, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.  

Fair Value Measurements. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements.  

Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment may be required when determining the following: whether services are considered distinct and should be accounted for separately; when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. 

Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time and are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value).  

The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $183 million and $338 million, respectively for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and totaled $156 million and $297 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  

The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods. 

The Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Therefore, carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments/investments of consolidated VIEs or cash/cash of consolidated VIEs to the extent that it is distributed, on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.  

Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest its sales proceeds.  

The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $242 million and $219 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other  

72 

liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 13, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

Fees earned for technology services revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis.  

Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. 

Distribution and service fees represent fees earned for distributing investment products and for providing other support services to investment portfolios, are based on net asset values, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
