Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations Web site (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels, as well as social media, to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the United States ("U.S.") social media channels listed on our investor relations Web site.

We are the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 130 million streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the U.S., our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.

We are a pioneer in the internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the internet. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments. Increasingly, our membership growth is impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content, which may affect historical seasonal patterns. Internationally, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.

Our core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our profit margin targets. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.

The following represents our consolidated performance highlights:

Consolidated revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 40%, including an increase of 26% and 65% in revenues in the Domestic streaming and International streaming segments, respectively, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. International revenues accounted for 49% of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to 42% of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 54% of total average paid streaming memberships as of June 30, 2018, as compared to 48% of total average paid streaming memberships for the same period in 2017. In addition, the average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership increased primarily due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans.

The increase in operating income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion, and our growing content production activities. The increase in net income was comprised of an increase in operating income coupled with an increase in foreign exchange gains primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated senior note, partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily due to the higher principal of senior notes outstanding.

We offer three types of streaming membership plans. Our “basic” plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our “standard” plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our “premium” plan includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. As of June 30, 2018, pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $4 to $20 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase.

The following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:

•We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. It represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs. As markets within our International streaming segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating margin as a measure of profitability.

•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the vast majority of cost of revenues. Increasingly, we obtain multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content, streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.

•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPD's, mobile operators and ISP's. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

In the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The 26% increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to the 11% growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as a 13% increase in the average monthly revenue per paying membership, resulting from our price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans. Our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships.

The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $55.3 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $38.4 million primarily due to an increase in other content-related costs, and an increase in payment processing fees which grew due to our growing member base.

Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising and public relations, as well as increased payments to our partners.

Our Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 39% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and increased as compared to the contribution margin of 37% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as growth in paid memberships and revenue outpaced content spend.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

The 25% increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to the 11% growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as a 12% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership, resulting from our price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans.

The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $176.8 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $62.3 million primarily due to an increase in other content-related costs, and an increase in payment processing fees which grew due to our growing member base.

Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising and public relations, as well as increased payments to our partners.

Our Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 39% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, which remained flat when compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

In the International streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The 65% increase in our international revenues was due to the 41% growth in the average number of paid international memberships, in addition to a 17% increase in the average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in the average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans coupled with favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues in the second quarter of 2018 would have been approximately $65.0 million lower if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with the foreign exchange rates from the second quarter of 2017. If foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.

The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $211.8 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $94.8 million primarily due to increases in other content-related costs, as well as increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base.

International marketing expenses increased mainly due to increased advertising and public relations, as well as increased payments to our partners.

International contribution profit for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $298.1 million as opposed to a contribution loss of $13.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as profit growth in our more mature markets offset investments in newer markets.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

The 67% increase in our international revenues was due to the 41% growth in our average number of paid international memberships, in addition to a 19% increase in the average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in the average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans coupled with favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2018 would have been approximately $179.3 million lower if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with the foreign exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $533.4 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $184.7 million primarily due to increases increases in other content-related costs, as well as increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations.

International marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased mainly due to increased advertising and public relations, as well as increased payments to our partners.

International contribution profit grew to $570.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $29.6 million profit for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as profit growth in our more mature markets offset investments in newer markets.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

In the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services. The price per plan for DVD-by-mail varies from $4.99 to $14.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member. DVD-by-mail plans differ by the number of DVDs that a

member may have out at any given point. Members electing access to high definition Blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition DVDs, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $3 per month for our most popular plans. Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses such as packaging and postage costs, content expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customer service centers. The number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue.

Our Domestic DVD segment contribution margin was 57% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 54% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to the decreased DVD usage by paying members and decreased DVD content expenses.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

Our Domestic DVD segment contribution margin was 57% for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 52% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, due to the decreased DVD usage by paying members and decreased DVD content expenses.

Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for all technology personnel, as well as other costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure. Technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $45.8 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from an increase in compensation for existing employees and growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $83.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from an increase in compensation for existing employees and a growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.

General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel, as well as for personnel that support global functions related to content, marketing, public relations and operations other than customer service. General and administrative expenses also includes professional fees and other general corporate expenses.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a $79.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from an increase in average headcount primarily to support our international and original content expansion, and an increase in compensation for existing employees. In addition, facilities-related costs increased $11.4 million, primarily driven by costs for our Los Gatos, California headquarters and Los Angeles, California facility. Third party expenses, including costs for contractors and consultants, also increased $4.5 million.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a $147.4 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, resulting from an increase in average headcount primarily to support our international and original content expansion, and an increase in compensation for existing employees. In addition, facilities-related costs increased $17.5 million, primarily driven by costs for our Los Gatos, California headquarters and Los Angeles, California facility. In addition, third party expenses, including costs for contractors and consultants, increased $10.2 million.

Interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding long-term debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, as well as interest on our lease financing obligations.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

Interest expense primarily consisted of interest on our Notes of $98.7 million and $177.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 is due to the increase in long-term debt.

Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

Interest and other income (expense) increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a foreign exchange gain of $58.1 million and loss of $13.6 million, respectively, compared to losses of $60.7 million and $49.4 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2017. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the foreign exchange gains (losses) were primarily driven by the $85.4 million and $44.3 million, respectively, gains from the remeasurement of our €1,300.0 million Senior Notes, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses, and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.

The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017 was due primarily to lower benefit on a percentage basis from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation as well as additional expense related to foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses, and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work is still necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $1,091.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the issuance of debt, partially offset by cash used in operations.

Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $1,842.6 million due to the issuance of debt in April 2018, partially offset by the remeasurement of our euro denominated notes. The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021. As of June 30, 2018, no amounts had been borrowed under the $500.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 5 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market, as we continue to believe that our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.

Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content.

production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.

We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.

Three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017

Net cash used in operating activities decreased $16.3 million to $518.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decreased use of cash was primarily driven by a $1,121.8 million or 40% increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $595.7 million, from $2,149.5 million to $2,745.2 million, or 28% as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $267.0 million, from $1,550.8 million to $1,817.8 million, or 17%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to a $37.9 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment for our Los Gatos and Los Angeles headquarter offices partially offset by a $17.5 million decrease in the proceeds from the sale and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $489.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt from $1,405.5 million, net of $15.0 million issuance costs in the three months ended June 30, 2017, to $1,883.0 million, net of $17.0 million issuance costs in the three months ended June 30, 2018.

Non-GAAP free cash flow was $942.9 million lower than net income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to $927.4 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $96.7 million in other non-favorable working capital differences partially offset by $81.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

Non-GAAP free cash flow was $674.0 million lower than net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to $598.7 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense coupled with $119.3 million of non-favorable other working capital differences partially offset by $44.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

Six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017

Net cash used in operating activities decreased $123.4 million to $755.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decreased use of cash was primarily driven by a $2,186 million or 40% increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $1,221.2 million, from $4,131.9 million to $5,353.1 million, or 30% as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $710.2 million, from $2,856.5 million to $3,566.7 million, or 25%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $42.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to a $53.3 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment for our Los Gatos and Los Angeles headquarter offices and a $9.6 million decrease in the acquisition of DVD content assets partially offset by a $20.6 million decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $520.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, due to the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,883.0 million, net of $17.0 million of issuance costs.

Free cash flow was $1,519.5 million lower than net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to $1,786.4 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $117.3 million favorable other working capital differences and $149.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.

Free cash flow was $1,274.8 million lower than net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to $1,275.5 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense coupled with $88.2 million non-favorable other working capital differences partially offset by $88.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of June 30, 2018. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018:

Streaming content obligations increased $0.5 billion from $17.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $18.4 billion as of June 30, 2018, primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.

Streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.

(2)Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

(3)Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $13.2 million related to a portion of our current Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $487.8 million for our headquarters in Los Gatos, California, and our office space in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $266.1 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2028.

(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.

As of June 30, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $56.1 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.

We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.

The information set forth under Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Indemnification” is incorporated herein by reference.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.

Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.

Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.

We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.

Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and

the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.

In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of June 30, 2018, the valuation allowance of $103.4 million was related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.

We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At June 30, 2018, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $56.1 million of which $52.3 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
