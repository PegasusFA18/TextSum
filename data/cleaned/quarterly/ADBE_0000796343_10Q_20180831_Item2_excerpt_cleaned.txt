Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and certain local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).

Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from this site free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov. The information posted to our website is not incorporated into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

For our third quarter of fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Experience (formerly Digital Marketing), while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.

In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-based services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which help assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.

We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content

Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.

We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.

We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.

Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2018 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2018 and held constant throughout the year.

Creative ARR exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $5.66 billion up from $4.77 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Document Cloud ARR exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $744 million, up from $614 million at the end of fiscal 2017. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $6.40 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $5.39 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.

Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.36 billion, up from $1.06 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $248.9 million, up from $206.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $1.61 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $1.27 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, representing 27% year-over-year growth.

We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.

Our hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment, available in our Adobe Experience Cloud, consists of the following cloud offerings:

•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Adobe Social and Adobe Primetime.

•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.

•Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (“AMO”) and Adobe’s acquisition of TubeMogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

In addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.

In June 2018, we acquired privately-held commerce platform company Magento Commerce (“Magento”), and we began integrating Magento into our Digital Experience business in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.

We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $614.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing 21% year-over-year growth. Driving the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $494.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $395.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue, to a lesser extent, was revenue associated with Magento’s commerce platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Magento and continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions will drive revenue growth in future years.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, in order to more closely align our Digital Experience segment with the strategic growth opportunity, we moved two legacy enterprise offerings, LiveCycle and Connect, from our Digital Experience segment to our Publishing segment.

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.

There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended August 31, 2018, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 1, 2017.

See Note 1 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance or potential significance to us.

Revenue for the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 (dollars in millions)

Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning on the commencement of the service.

As described in Note 15 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, we have the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. Subscription revenue by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 is as follows (dollars in millions):

Our services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise products and the sale of our hosted Adobe Experience Cloud services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.

Revenue from Digital Media increased $338.7 million and $995.6 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our Creative offerings.

Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue across all of our Creative Cloud offerings.

Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the year ago periods primarily due to increases in Document Cloud subscription revenue.

Revenue from Digital Experience increased $106.2 million and $273.6 million during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue associated with our offerings. Continued adoption of our AEM offerings which is part of our Marketing Cloud and growth in our Analytics Cloud largely contributed to subscription revenue year-over-year increases. Also contributing to the increase in subscription revenue was revenue associated with our commerce platform offerings from our acquisition of Magento in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Overall revenue during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 increased in all geographic regions as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 primarily due to increases in Digital Media and Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.

Foreign currency impacts to revenue for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 are shown below.

During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018, the relative weakness of the U.S. Dollar caused revenue in EMEA and other currencies measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to increase as compared to the year-ago periods.

Cost of Revenue for the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 (dollars in millions)

Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data center facilities. Our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items. Cost of subscription revenue also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory sources for our Advertising Cloud offerings.

Cost of subscription revenue increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 due to the following:

Royalty costs decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended September 1, 2017 primarily due to one-time accruals for payments due to certain vendors in the year-ago period.

Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.

Cost of product revenue declined slightly during the three months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended September 1, 2017. Cost of product revenue decreased during the nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to decreases in royalty costs.

Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.

Cost of services and support revenue increased slightly during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 due to increases in incentive compensation costs and professional and consulting fees.

Operating Expenses for the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 (dollars in millions)

Research and Development and Sales and Marketing Expenses

The increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 were primarily due to increases in base compensation and related benefits costs and stock-based compensation expenses associated with headcount growth, including headcount from Magento.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, third party fees for hosting services, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.

Research and development expenses increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 due to the following:

We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our subscription and service offerings, applications and tools.

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs.

Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 decreased slightly year over year primarily due to our revenue growing at a faster pace compared with the increases in sales and marketing expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 due to the following:

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance.

General and administrative expenses increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 due to the following:

Professional and consulting fees increased during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017 primarily due to incurred transaction costs associated with our acquisition of Magento, which closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net for the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 (dollars in millions)

(*) Percentage is less than 1%.

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.

Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 5 and 13 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our senior notes and interest rate swaps.

Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.

Provision for Income Taxes for the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 (dollars in millions)

Our effective tax rate decreased by 18 percentage points and 11 percentage points for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 1, 2017. The lower effective tax rates were primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 and a change to our corporate tax structure from which we serve our foreign customers that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against our earnings in the U.S.

The Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate tax rate is a blended rate of 22.2%, which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter.

We have made provisional estimates of the accounting impacts of certain provisions of the Tax Act. We continue to obtain, analyze and interpret additional guidance issued and will revise our estimates as additional information becomes available. The provisional accounting impacts may change in the subsequent reporting period when our accounting analysis is finalized, as permitted by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

As part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system we recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $118 million on deferred foreign earnings, which was comprised of $86 million for fiscal 2018 plus other ancillary effects recorded in the first fiscal quarter, long-term income taxes payable of $533 million, and a reduction in our deferred tax liability of $415 million. As a result of a change to our corporate tax structure that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against our earnings in the U.S., we updated our Tax Act calculation during the three months ended June 1, 2018. This included an additional provisional transition tax expense of $28 million on deferred foreign earnings, a decrease of deferred tax assets by $72 million which also included utilization of credits that we estimate will be available to reduce the transition tax, and a reduction of long-term income tax payable by $44 million. As a result of technical guidance updates on the interpretations of the Tax Act available in the quarter, we updated our Tax Act calculation during the three months ended August 31, 2018. The application of this guidance resulted in an additional net provisional tax expense of $24 million, a decrease of net deferred tax assets by $25 million, an increase in unrecognized tax benefits included in the long-term income tax payable of $69 million, a reduction of the short-term income taxes payable of $7 million, and a reduction to the long-term income tax payable of $62 million. To calculate the transition tax, we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal 2018 because the information needed to complete the calculation will not be known until our taxable income is known. In addition, U.S. and foreign audit settlements may significantly impact the estimated transition tax. The impact of the U.S. and foreign audits on the transition tax will be known as the audits are concluded. We intend to elect to pay the federal transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we reclassified $39 million from long-term income taxes payable to short-term income taxes payable for the first installment payment due in fiscal 2019. During the three months ended August 31, 2018, we reclassified $5 million from short-term income taxes payable to long-term income taxes payable as a result of the updated technical guidance on the interpretations of the Tax Act.

We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. As part of the adoption of a territorial tax system, the Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. As we repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax.

See Note 8 for further information regarding the provision for income taxes and impacts related to the Tax Act on our financial statements.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

The gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $231.3 million and $175.7 million as of August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits benefits at August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017 were recognized in the future, $186.0 million and $138.3 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates, which were net of estimated $45.3 million and $37.4 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.

The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.1 million and $22.0 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $50.0 million.

This data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

A summary of our cash flows is as follows:

Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.92 billion for the nine months ended August 31, 2018 was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items, including adjustments to deferred income taxes related to the Tax Act. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in income taxes payable, decrease in accounts receivable, and an increase in deferred revenue. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily driven by the provisional transition tax liability recorded pursuant to the Tax Act. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by improved revenue linearity. The increase in deferred revenue was principally due to increases in Digital Media site and term licenses and from our acquisition of Magento in third quarter of fiscal 2018. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses driven by the timing of billings and payments of maintenance and support services associated with our licensed technologies, and increases in prepaid payroll and employee benefits.

Net cash used for investing activities of $1.55 billion for the nine months ended August 31, 2018 was primarily due to our acquisition of Magento, and purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.

Net cash used for financing activities of $1.93 billion for the nine months ended August 31, 2018 was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by proceeds from reissuance of treasury stock. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.

In September 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement under which we expect to acquire Marketo, Inc. (“Marketo”) for approximately $4.75 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2018. We expect to finance the acquisition using existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, newly issued debt or drawings from our existing revolving credit agreement. We believe that these resources, in addition to cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the acquisition. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of Marketo.

Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations

Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions.

As a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, all historical undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings were subject to a mandatory one-time transition tax. The Tax Act resulted in a provisional transition tax liability of $427 million and state taxes of $3 million as of August 31, 2018. Under the Tax Act, the transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As we repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Act and the future cash needs of our global operations to determine the amount of foreign earnings that is not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.

Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part II, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through July 27, 2020. As of August 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.

As of August 31, 2018, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025.

Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.

To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved our current stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us another authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.

During the nine months ended August 31, 2018 and September 1, 2017, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.75 billion and $800 million, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.

The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During the nine months ended August 31, 2018, we repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares at an average price of $225.15 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and the nine months ended August 31, 2018. During the nine months ended September 1, 2017 we repurchased approximately 6.3 million shares at an average price of $126.58 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and the nine months ended September 1, 2017.

For the nine months ended August 31, 2018, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by August 31, 2018 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of August 31, 2018, $247.3 million of prepayment remained under this agreement.

 As of August 31, 2018, $150 million remains under the $2.5 billion authority and we have not drawn from our $8 billion authority.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments as of August 31, 2018 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. There have been no material changes in those obligations during the nine months ended August 31, 2018. See Notes 12 and 13 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our contractual commitments.

Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At August 31, 2018, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $275.4 million for the remaining duration of our senior notes.

Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of August 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants.

Under the terms of our credit agreement we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.

In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.

To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited, however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
